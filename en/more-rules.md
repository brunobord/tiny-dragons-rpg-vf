# Tiny Dragons: Convocation

Additional rules, options, ideas for your Tiny Dragons game.

## MORE BREATH WEAPONS

The magical language of dragons is comprised of many more than the five power words. As with the five original magical words, speaking them is required and yelling them gains +1 to the Magic roll.

**Sound:** Effective for scaring things off and breaking crystals and glass, but can also attract unwanted attention.

**Webbing:** Useful for dissuading pursuers or trapping very small enemies or bugs. If you’re not careful though, you can end up wrapped up in your own webs!

**Darkness:** your magic enshrouds an area in total darkness through which only you can see, which is excellent for hiding your efforts even amongst un-hypnotized giants. But hidden inside that power is evil energy that can raise the dead and animate enemies from whatever is laying about.

**Water:** a stream that can be as gentle as a mist or as powerful as a cannon (so at tiny dragon scale, about as strong as a good squirt gun). Similar to darkness magic above, water contains in it powerful life energy that can cause unexpected and unwanted growth should you misuse this magic.

**Luck:** some tiny dragons’ magic can make even the most unlikely of events line up in their favor. The downside to this is terrible bad luck, where even the most outrageous of outcomes becomes possible.

## THE CONVOCATION

Dragons often call to one another for assistance. Two, then three and then who knows how many may answer the call! They’ll always answer the call, eager to see more of the world, grow their own hoards and display their own forms of magic, valor and lore.

A Convocation can be made up of many dragons sharing a single hypnotized giant, or multiple giant/dragon pairs, or any combination. 

A Convocation of dragons is invariably more powerful than its individuals. However, dragons are most definitely individuals. They can get together and they can work together, but staying together can be hard.

### Combining Efforts

When a convocation combines its magic, designate a leader. That dragon rolls +Magic. On a 10+ you get the awesome benefit of the combined magicks. On a 7-9 you get something but one of the elements of the combination does something unexpected. On a 6- the entire convocation falls to squabbling (see below)

Tiny dragons can also combine their valor to achieve what might otherwise only be possible with a giant’s assistance. The rules are similar: designate a leader to roll, but this time add +1 for each helping dragon. On a 10+ the group does what it was attempting, on a 7-9 there’s some complication along the way as a result of too many conflicting agendas, and on a 6- again with the squabbling. 

Each dragon helping with something doubles their individual valor: one dragon can carry a penny or button or small fruit (strawberry, grape), two can carry 2, three can carry 4, four can carry 8 and so on. Put enough tiny dragons together and the giant ally is hardly necessary!

And finally, of course, tiny dragons often put their heads together to figure things out. As with valor, add +1 for each dragon helping with a lore roll. 

### Squabbling

The consequence of the convocation failing to combine their efforts is that the dragons fall to squabbling. They can’t stand to be in the same place together, so they head in opposite directions as fast as possible.

The only way for dragons to stop squabbling is if they offer each other gifts: either something another dragon likes to hoard, or something they like to eat. Once each dragon has exchanged at least one thing with each other, the squabble is over. Until then, though, they’ll do nothing but scream and fight with each other should they find themselves in sight of one another. The un-hypnotized giants cannot help but notice a bunch of squabbling dragons, either! Your giant ally should probably keep everyone separated, but in case it doesn’t you should instruct your giant to loudly proclaim “no dragons fighting here! Nothing to worry about!” to redirect suspicion about the screeching and clawing.

## OTHER TINY DENIZENS

Sometimes you’ll discover that what you thought was a giant’s small statuary is actually a tiny something of its own! They, like you, have to be very careful around the giants and their hatchlings, and have found their own way in this world.

The role of the tiny denizen will not be obvious to you at first. Ask your giant the nature of the denizen (choose from one below) and roll +Lore to confirm its role. On a 10+ your giant was right, and you can strike up a conversation or otherwise interact with it. On a 7-9 the giant got it wrong: it’s some other kind of denizen and you’ve vaguely insulted it, but you can impress or intimidate it with your magic, valor or lore. On a 6- it’s not a tiny denizen at all and that is so embarrassing: go rest for the day and recover your ego.

In all cases, you’ve tired out the denizen for the day. You can talk with them another time. Their role remains the same.

**Observers:** quiet and reflective, observers have learned a lot about the giant’s world. Ask it three questions and it will answer truthfully, but it’ll also ask you to do something in return.

**Guardians:** sworn to protect a place or thing, guardians are stern and serious. Ask it what it guards and it will answer truthfully. You can either persuade the guardian to act in a way that furthers its oath, or challenge it to gain access to whatever it is protecting.

**Exiles:** these denizens have come from another place just like you, and they can help you fill in the gaps about where you’re from and how you ended up here. Ask it three questions and it will answer truthfully.
