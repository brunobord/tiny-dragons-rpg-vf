# Tiny Dragons

You are a tiny dragon. Start acting like one.
A persistent, real-time, all-the-time solo RPG thing.

## Tiny Dragons: The Rules

You are a tiny dragon.

Tiny, as in smaller than a strawberry! It’s not clear how it came to be that you’re alive and well and, you know, a dragon. Maybe you’re dreaming; maybe your true dragon form is huge and fierce in some other world. But in this world you’ve got the wings, you’ve got the breath weapon…and you’ve got a powerful urge to hoard all you can get your tiny claws on. The giants who also inhabit this place may or may not notice your efforts.

### Your Hoard

Hoarding stuff is hard when you’re small, and stuff is mostly bigger than you. What you want to hoard is up to you, but you’re picky about it whatever it is. Here are ideas of things to hoard, or make up your own:

* **Coins**: they tend to be heavy, and if you take too many of them they tend to be noticed.
* **Buttons**: often attached to the giants’ clothes, and most definitely noticed when they go missing.
* **Statuary**: the giants’ hatchlings often leave small likenesses of creatures and vehicles scattered around their nest. Hatchlings hate it when their statuary goes missing! They’re the most dangerous things in the nest.

Whatever you hoard, think about the difficulties you may face trying to collect it.

### Diet

Being so tiny and fierce is hard work! So you need to eat and eat to keep moving. What’s you preferred diet?

* **Fruit**: not every nest has it. Any plant will do in a pinch, but fruit is sweet and delicious and much preferred.
* **Bugs**: sometimes they fight back. Sometimes there’s more of them than you.
* **Meat**: hard to get without the giants putting it out. Blood from the giants is an acceptable substitute but watch out! They don’t like to be bitten.

### Your Magic

One of the legacies of your great race is that your soul finds expression through your breath weapon. It’s not really “breath” at all, it’s your spoken language woven with magic, but the net result is the same: vast destruction in a manner of your choosing.

* **Fire**: tends to spread out of control
* **Ice**:  difficult to do much damage at your current scale
* **Acid**: hard to be precise but it continues to eat through what it touches
* **Lightning**: occasionally awakens the strange statuary prized by the giants’ hatchlings
* **Force**: pushes things, maybe too far or too hard if you’re not careful.

### Abilities

Every dragon is represented by a few stats, as well as one selection from the previous three lists. Put a +1 next to one of these, a 0 beside another, and -1 beside the last. When you need to do things, you’ll roll two six-sided dice and modify it with this stat (depending on what you’re trying to do).

* **Magic**: the power behind your breath weapon. Used for deploying your weaponized language in interesting and non-destructive ways (use Valor if you’re just blasting something). The power of your magic is in the volume at which you speak it: normal speaking voice is a minimum – no whispering your breath weapon! If you shout your magic, gain +1. Naturally, other giants in the area may take an interest.
* **Valor**: your personal bravery and physical strength. Used for flying, being fast, fighting bugs, carrying heavy things.
* **Lore**: understanding how giants work, and figuring out how to avoid them

There’s one more very useful magical ability that you possess in your very small form: you can hypnotize a single giant into doing your bidding. Pick one. She or he will help you move around its nest, hide you when needed, place you where your wings can’t quite fly you.

You can wander off without your hypnotized giant and the spell won’t be broken. Have you picked your giant? Okay, let’s proceed.

Remember, only *your* giant has been hypnotized! Other giants, as well as their hatchlings, enormous animal companions, and other random bugs and threats are not affected. You’ll need to use your *magic*, *valor* and *lore* to overcome obstacles that your personal giant can’t do for you.

Biting your own giant for blood is the only thing that will break the hypnosis. If it’s broken, watch out! It probably won’t appreciate the fact it’s been under your spell this whole time.

### Playing

So now that you’re a dragon, it’s time to build your hoard.

Your life is now comprised of two things: gathering your hoard and feeding yourself. Every time you roll dice, you must feed. You can’t roll dice again until you feed (unless you need to roll dice to feed, that’s okay).

If you’re in the nest alone with your giant, cool, gathering your hoard is easy and you won’t even need to feed. Instruct your giant to move you about the nest, gather what you desire, and build your hoard somewhere in the house. Enjoy your possessions. Luxuriate in your hard work.

Eventually it won’t be enough. Each day, you’ll need to add one new item to your hoard. And the other giants might discover your hoard as well! If they do, they’ll probably steal everything from you! All that hard work, gone to waste.

Doing things when other giants are around will require your giant **roll dice**(the normal kinds that look like cubes with dots) on your behalf. If you need to use your breath weapon, roll two dice and add Magic. If you need to fight something or fly or be very fast, roll and add your Valor. If you need to figure something out about giants (like how to avoid them, or use their strange contraptions), you’ll need to roll and add Lore.

Before you roll, consult with your giant. What does your giant think will be the worst possible outcome of failure? This is their world, they have a better idea of this than you. If you need to prompt your giant, look at the consequences and difficulties already written into the items on the lists.

**If you roll 10 or more**, you did the thing: you defeated the bug, hauled the coin, used acid to break the lock.

**If you roll 7-9**, you can do the thing if you can handle an added obstacle. It’ll take another roll, which might mean more obstacles, and so on. Eventually you may need to command your giant to take you away entirely. No more hoard gathering today! Feed and rest and come back another day.

**If you roll 6 or less**, you can’t do the thing, at least not the way you were trying: if you were using magic, for example, maybe valor will work instead. Look at each item in the list and you’ll see that there’s both a description of the thing (hoard desire, food, breath) and some consequences. If you rolled 6 or less, the consequence is what happens! The giants notice you’ve taken coins, or you get into a fight with bugs, or your fire breath burns too hot and too far.

So how long can you live in this place? How large a hoard can you amass? Here’s a secret: dragons can consume 5 of their hoard items and give themselves a single +1 to any of their three abilities. This might be needed to ultimately gather your Final Hoard: 50 items of your desire. It may take a while. Weeks or months, even. And hiding a hoard of that size is no easy task.

It is said, but not known for sure, that acquiring your Final Hoard will allow you to return to your own world, giant and mighty as was intended by your ancestors.

## Additional Rules

### Playing with a Giant Hatchling

You may find you’ve hypnotized a giant that has not yet fully matured. This is an easy thing to do if you’re unfamiliar with these creatures’ odd physiology. An immature giant may be enthusiastic in service to you but unwise in the risks of the world.

If you’re playing this game with a kid who needs help figuring out risks and consequences for the rolls, easy enough: an adult helper (who is “invisible” for the duration of the game, therefore doesn’t trigger rolls) can tell the tiny dragon the risks and consequences. But the kid needs to provide the physical assistance to the tiny dragon: flying, reaching, carrying and anything else needed. The adult needs to be responsible for stopping the child when it’s time to roll dice.

### Many Tiny Dragons

More than one tiny dragon may be at work building a hoard in a giant’s nest. This is totally okay, but keep in mind:

- Each dragon can only hypnotize one giant
- Another hypnotized giant does not count as “other giants” and does not make you roll dice
- Every tiny dragon should be gathering a different hoard.

That said, every dragon is different. Some are territorial and will stop at nothing to interfere with other dragons at work in the nest. Others are friendly, others still shy. Each one is different.

**Powered by the Apocalypse**

The game is, of course, very loosely based on the Apocalypse World/Powered by the Apocalypse system created by Vincent Baker.
